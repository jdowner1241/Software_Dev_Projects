Task Manager / To-Do List Application

Project Description:
Create a console-based task manager or to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks and to-do lists. This project is ideal for beginners as it covers various fundamental C++ concepts and can be built incrementally.

Features to Implement:

Task Creation: Allow users to add tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority level.

Task Listing: Display a list of tasks with relevant details, including their completion status.

Task Modification: Enable users to mark tasks as completed, edit task details, and delete tasks.

Data Storage: Implement a basic file-based storage system to save and load tasks between sessions. You can start with simple text files for this.

Task Sorting: Allow users to sort tasks based on priority, due date, or completion status.

User-Friendly Interface: Create a user-friendly menu-driven interface that guides users through task management operations.

Learning Opportunities:

Basic Input/Output: Learn how to take user input and display information in the console.
Data Structures: Use arrays or vectors to store and manage tasks.
File Handling: Learn how to read and write data to text files for persistent storage.
Conditional Statements: Implement logic for task sorting and filtering.
Loops: Create loops for menu navigation and iterating through tasks.
Functions: Organize code into functions for modularity and readability.
Error Handling: Implement error handling for cases like incorrect user input.
Project Progression:

Start with the core functionality, such as task creation and listing, and gradually add more features as you become more comfortable with C++. For instance, you can begin with manual data storage (tasks stored in memory), and then add file-based storage later.

This project allows you to learn and practice C++ basics while creating a practical and useful application. Plus, as you become more skilled, you can continue to enhance and expand the application with additional features, such as task categorization, due date reminders, and advanced sorting options.

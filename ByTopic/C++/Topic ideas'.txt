Basic Calculator: Ask learners to create a simple calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.

Guess the Number Game: Have learners create a number guessing game where the computer generates a random number, and the user has to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

Student Record System: Encourage learners to build a program that stores and manages student records. It should allow adding, updating, deleting, and displaying student information.

To-Do List Manager: Have learners create a console-based to-do list manager where users can add, edit, delete, and list tasks. This project can introduce concepts of data structures (e.g., arrays or linked lists).

Simple Banking System: Challenge learners to create a basic banking system with features like creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, and checking account balances. This project can involve using classes and object-oriented programming.

Text-Based Adventure Game: This project can be more advanced. Learners can design and implement a text-based adventure game where users navigate through a story, make choices, and see different outcomes based on their decisions. It can involve conditional statements and loops.

File Handling: File Viewer/Editor: Teach learners how to read and write files in C++. Have them create a simple text file viewer or editor that allows users to read, modify, and save text files.

Data Structures: Introduce data structures like stacks, queues, or linked lists, and have learners implement these data structures from scratch or use them in practical projects. For example, they can create a simple text editor using a linked list.

Sorting Algorithms Visualizer: Have learners create a program that visually demonstrates sorting algorithms like bubble sort, quicksort, or merge sort. It can help reinforce understanding of algorithmic concepts.

Mini-Project: Encourage learners to come up with their own project ideas. For example, they could build a simple game, a chat application, or a basic website using C++ for server-side scripting.

Remember to provide clear objectives and guidelines for each activity, and encourage learners to comment their code and follow best practices in coding style and documentation. These activities can be adapted to different skill levels, from beginners to more experienced programmers.
